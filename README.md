# Ender3Pro-MarlinConfig
Ender3 Pro marlin config for my personal machine

Note that most settings are the example config with increased thermal overload settings, while this allowed for my printer to print ABS in cold tempature without nusance thermal runaway errors, it can also prevent real runaway tempatures from being caught.

Use with caution.
